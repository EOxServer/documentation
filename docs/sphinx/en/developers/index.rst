EOxServer Developers' Guide
===========================

The Developers' Guide is intended for people who want to use EOxServer
as a development framework for geospatial services, or do have to
extend EOxServer's functionality to implement specific data and metadata
formats for instance.

Users of the EOxServer software stack please refer to the 
:ref:`EOxServer Users' Guide`. Users range from administrators installing and 
configuring the software stack over operators registering the available data 
to end users consuming the registered data.
