Mailing Lists
=============

Users Mailing List
------------------

The users mailing list is the primary means for EOxServer users and
developers to exchange and discuss ideas and potential software improvements, 
and to ask questions. 

Subscribe at http://eoxserver.org/mailman/listinfo/users/. You can later 
change your subscription information or unsubscribe from the list at this 
website too.

Here are some points to remember when posting to the list:

* Search the archive at http://eoxserver.org/pipermail/users/ for your answer 
  first, people get tired of answering the same questions over and over.
* Before posting subscribe to the list by following the procedure described 
  above.
* Post questions to the list by sending an email message to users@eoxserver.org.
* Provide version and configuration information for your EOxServer
  installation, like relevant snippets of your configuration files.
* Always post your responses back to the whole list, as opposed to just the
  person who replied to your question.
* Questions to the list are usually answered quickly and often by the 
  developers themselves.
 

Dev Mailing List
------------------

A separate mailing list is available for EOxServer developers. It is meant to be
used by individuals working on EOxServer source code and related libraries to
discuss issues that would not be of interest to the entire users mailing list.

Subscribe at http://eoxserver.org/mailman/listinfo/dev/. You can later change 
your subscription information or unsubscribe from the list at this website too.

The archive is located at http://eoxserver.org/pipermail/dev/.
