Installation on CentOS
======================

This article describes the installation procedure for EOxServer on a `CentOS
<http://www.centos.org/>`_ system. In this example, a raw CentOS 6.2 minimal
image is used.

This installation example is complementary to the standard :ref:`Installation`
manual.


Prerequisites
-------------

This example requires a running CentOS installation with superuser privileges
available.


Preparation of RPM repositories
-------------------------------

The default repositories of CentOS do not provide all software packages
required for EOxServer, and some packages are only provided in out-dated
versions. Thus several further repositories have to be added to the system's
list.

The first one is the `ELGIS (Enterprise Linux GIS)
<http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Enterprise_Linux_GIS>`_ repository which can be
added with the following `yum` command:
::

    sudo rpm -Uvh http://elgis.argeo.org/repos/6/elgis-release-6-6_0.noarch.rpm

The second repository to be added is `EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise
Linux) <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ again via a simple `yum` command:
::

    sudo rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm

EOxServer requires several adjustments to existing packages to work correctly 
which can be easily obtained from the yum repository at `packages.eox.at 
<http://packages.eox.at>`_. This repository offers current versions of packages 
like `MapServer <http://mapserver.org/>`_ as well as custom built ones with 
extra drivers enabled like `GDAL <http://gdal.org/>`_ and/or with patches 
applied like `libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_. It is not mandatory to use this
repository but it is highly recommended in order for all features of EOxServer 
to work correctly.

The repository is easily installed:
::

    cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
    sudo wget http://packages.eox.at/eox.repo
    sudo rpm --import http://packages.eox.at/eox-package-maintainers.gpg
    sudo yum update


Installation of required software packages
------------------------------------------

Now the required packages can be installed with only one command:
::

    sudo yum install gcc gdal gdal-devel gdal-python libxml2 libxml2-python \
                     mapserver mapserver-python sqlite sqlite-devel \
                     python-lxml python-pip python-devel

Further packages may be required if additional features (e.g: a full DBMS) are
desired.

For installation of Python packages `pip <www.pip-installer.org/>`_ is used,
which iself was installed in the previous step. It automatically resolves and
installs all dependencies. So a simple
::

    sudo pip-python install eoxserver

suffices to install EOxServer itself.

When used with `spatialite <http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/>`_ EOxServer
also requires `pysqlite <http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/>`_. Unfortunately
pysqlite is built by default without a required parameter. Thus it has to be
installed manually:
::

    wget http://pysqlite.googlecode.com/files/pysqlite-2.6.0.tar.gz
    tar xzf pysqlite-2.6.0.tar.gz
    cd pysqlite-2.6.0

Now `setup.cfg` needs to be opened with a text editor (like `vi`) and the line
::

    define=SQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION

has to be deleted or commented. Pysqlite can now be installed with:
::

    sudo python setup.py install

The ``--init_spatialite`` flag of the ``create_instance`` command of the 
``eoxserver-admin.py`` script used to initialize a sqlite database needs 
pyspatialite:
::

    sudo yum install libspatialite-devel geos-devel proj-devel
    sudo pip-python install pyspatialite

Now that EOxServer is properly install the next step is to :ref:`create and configure
an instance <Creating an Instance>`.
