.. _Synchronization:

Synchronization
===============

This section describes why and how to synchronize an EOxServer instance with
the file system.

What is synchronization?
------------------------

In the context of EOxServer, synchronization is the process of updating the
database models for container objects (such as RectifiedStitchedMosaics or
DatasetSeries) according to changes in the file system.


Reasons for Synchronization
---------------------------

There are several occasions, where synchronization is necessary:

 * A file has been added to a folder associated with a container
 * A file from a folder associated with a container has been removed
 * EO Metadata has been changed
 * A regular check for database consistency

HowTo
-----

Synchronization can be triggered by a custom `Django admin command
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/>`_, called
``eoxs_synchronize``.

To start the synchronization process, navigate to your instances directory and
type:
::

    python manage.py eoxs_synchronize <IDs>

whereas ``<IDs>`` are the coverage/EO ID of the containers that shall be
synchronized.

Alternatively, with the ``-a`` or ``--all`` option, all container objects in
the database will be synchronized. This option is useful for a dayly cron-job,
ensuring the databases consistency with the file system.
::

    python manage.py eoxs_synchronize --all

The synchronization process may take some time, especially when FTP/Rasdaman
storages are used and also depends on the number of synchronized objects.
