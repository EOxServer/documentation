EOxServer is a Python application and framework for presenting Earth
Observation (EO) data and metadata.

EOxServer implements the `OGC <http://www.opengeospatial.org/>`_ 
Implementation Specifications EO-WCS and EO-WMS on top of 
`MapServer's <http://mapserver.org>`_
`WCS <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs>`_ and 
`WMS <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms>`_ implementations.

EOxServer is released under the 
:ref:`EOxServer Open License <EOxServer Open License>` a MIT-style 
license and written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and entirely based on 
Open Source software including `MapServer <http://mapserver.org>`_, 
`Django/GeoDjango <https://www.djangoproject.com>`_, 
`GDAL <http://www.gdal.org>`_, 
`SpatiaLite <http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/>`_, or 
`PostGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/>`_, and 
`PROJ.4 <http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/>`_.

The :ref:`EOxServer Global Use Case <Global Use Case>` provides a good starting 
point to understand the motivation and purpose of EOxServer.

If you're looking for support or want to contact the EOxServer community please 
have a look at the :ref:`EOxServer Mailing Lists <Mailing Lists>`.

The :ref:`Demonstration` together with the :ref:`EO-WCS Request Parameters` 
page show off the functionality available with EOxServer.

If you finally decided to give EOxServer a try please have a look at the 
:ref:`Installation` guide.

In order to register data in EOxServer you might want to explore the 
:ref:`Administration Web Application Tutorial`.

The EOxServer community considers security i.e. authentication and 
authorization an important topic and provides some security considerations in 
the :ref:`Identity Management System` page.

Last but not least there is the :ref:`soap proxy` component which you might 
want to use when you need SOAP bindings for your services.
